# Stretch's Node Stash

A random collection of nodes for [InvokeAI](https://github.com/invoke-ai/InvokeAI)

## Install

- Manual
    - Hit the green Code button above and select Download ZIP.
    - Once downloaded extract the stretchs_node_stash folder in your invokeai/nodes folder.
    - Restart Invoke
- Git
    - Open a terminal/command prompt in the invokeai/nodes directory
    - enter `git clone https://github.com/TheCulprit/stretchs_node_stash.git`

## Node Breakdown

### Toggles

- `Integer Toggle` - Takes two integer inputs and allows the user to decide which is used based on a toggle.
- `Integer Collection Toggle` - Same as above but for Integer Collections.
- `String Toggle` - Same as above but for Strings.
- `String Collection Toggle` - Same as above but for String Collections.
- `Bool Toggle` - For Booleans.
- `Bool Collection Toggle` - For Boolean Collections.
- `Float Toggle` - For Floats.
- `Float Collection Toggle` - For Float Collections.
- `Image Toggle` - For Images.
- `Image Collection Toggle` - For Image Collections.
- `LoRA Toggle` - For LoRAs
- `LoRA Collection Toggle` - For LoRA Collections
- `Scheduler Toggle` - For Schedulers.
- `Model Toggle` - A generic model toggle. For input use ModelIdentifier node. Warning: All models will be selectable. Ensure the input models are of the same type and are output to something that can use that type or Invoke will throw errors.
- `SDXL Main Model Toggle` - Same as above but only for SDXL main models so much easier/safer to use.

### Name Grabbers

- `Model Name Grabber` - A little awkward but takes input from a Model Identifier node and outputs the model's name.
- `LoRA Name Grabber` - Same as above but only for LoRAs. 

### LoRA Tools

- `LoRA Collection From Path` - Returns a collection of nodes that have a partial match to the given path. (Mostly useful if your loras are stored on disk in a categorised directory structure)
- `Lookup LoRA Triggers` - Takes input from a LoRA Selector node and outputs the trigger phrases that are defined for that LoRA in the model manager.
- `Lookup LoRA Collection Triggers` - Same as above but for a whole collection of LoRAs. Outputs all triggers as string collection.
- `Random LoRA Mixer` - Takes a collection of LoRAs and returns a new, random collection based on the various input values.
- `Merge LoRA Collections` - Takes two collections of LoRAs and merges them into one Collection.
- `Reapply LoRA Weight` - Allows the setting of a LoRA's weight after it has been selected.

### String Tools

- `String Collection Joiner` - Takes in a Collection of of strings and returns a single string with all the entries separated by the given delimeter.
- `Load Text File To String` - Loads a file at the given path as a string and outputs it.
- `Load All Text Files In Folder` - Loads all files in the given directory which have the given extension as strings and returns them as a Collection of strings.
- `Merge String Collections` - Takes two collections of strings and merges them into one Collection.

### Misc

- `Random Aspect Ratio` - Selects a width & height between a suplied min & max aspect ratio that is appropriate for the supplied base model

### Debug Tools

- `Print String to Console` - Just prints the input string to the console in the selected colour combination. (Useful for quickly debugging string manipulations.)

### Compares
- `Compare Int` - Compares two integer inputs based on a user selected method and outputs a bool depending on the result. Includes greater than, less than, equal to and not equal to
- `Compare Float` - Same as above for floats
- `Compare String` - Same as above for strings. Includes equals, contains, starts with and ends with. Has an extra toggle to ignore case if required.

### Tracery

- `Tracery` - Implement's Kate Compton's [Tracery](http://tracery.io/) as an Invoke node. 
    - Tracery is a simple grammar system which can replace #tokens# with random elements from a given grammar.
    - Grammars are input as a collection of JSON strings which will be merged. Any duplicate grammar entries may be lost. 
    - The given prompt will be expanded and it's #tokens# replaced with random entries from the grammar. 
    - Example Grammar:
        ```json
        {
            "subject": [ "young woman", "old woman", "small puppy"],
            "food": [ "#main_course#", "#dessert#" ],
            "main_course": [ "steak and potatoes", "burger and fries", "spaghetti" ],
            "dessert": [ "ice cream", "chocolate bar", "nachas" ]
        }
    - Example Prompt:
        ```
        A photograph of #subject# eating #food#
    - Example Output:
        ```
        A small puppy eating burger and fries
    - Modifiers:
        - Modifers can be applied to tokens to vary the output by writing a `.` and the name of the modifier after the token. `#token.modifier#`. If a modifier takes arguments they go in brackets after the modifier name. `#token.modifier(argument1,argument2)#`
        - Available modifiers
            - ran - *Will only add the exapanded text to the output if a random chance is met*
                - Random chance must be given as an integer value out of 100
                - Usage: `#token.ran(50)#` for a 50 percent chance. 
            - replace - *Replaces some of the expanded output*
                - Usage: `#token.replace(thin,fat)` will replace any instance of `thin` in the expanded output with `fat`
        - If the resulting expanded text contains your token as `((token))` then it failed to find that token in the grammar and there may be an issue with your grammar.
        - This node implements [Tracery](http://tracery.io/) by Kate Compton, using code from the [Python version](https://github.com/aparrish/pytracery) by Allison Parrish.
